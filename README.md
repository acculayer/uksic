# UK Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

## Introduction
A library to parse and search the UK's derivative of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), provided by the UK's [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://ons.gov.uk).

## Usage

See the [examples directory](./docs/examples/) for ETL and searching examples.
General usage does not require ETL, as the ETL modules are used to build the static searchable lists.

## Notes
Although this project uses data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this project is not affiliated with the ONS.
